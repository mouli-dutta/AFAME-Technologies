## SMS Spam Classification

### Objective:
This internship project done under AFAME Technologies aims to build a machine learning model for classifying SMS messages as spam or legitimate (ham).</br>
The model utilizes techniques like TF-IDF for feature extraction and several classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.

### Dataset:
 The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. </br>
 It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.


### Results:

The performance of each classification algorithm is evaluated using accuracy as the main metric. Here are the accuracy scores achieved by each algorithm:

- Naive Bayes: 0.98
- Logistic Regression: 0.99
- Support Vector Machine: 0.97

### Conclusion:

Based on the evaluation results, Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy among the three algorithms. </br>
Further improvements can be made by fine-tuning hyperparameters or exploring more advanced techniques.
